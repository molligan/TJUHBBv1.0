Blood samples are drawn from patients that have been through the informed consent process and agreed to participate in the tumor biobank program.  Blood samples are obtained by personnel qualified to draw blood from patients in the cancer center, the hospital or in the physician’s office. Processed blood products are an important tumor biobank resource.

This standard operating procedure (SOP) describes how blood should be processed, accessioned and stored.  The SOP does not cover detailed safety procedures for handling blood and it is recommended that personnel follow institutional biosafety guidelines.

}
[/block]
This procedure is intended to ensure that blood samples obtained from consented participants are processed in a safe and efficient manner while eliminating the risks of contamination and loss.

# Timing for Blood Collection and Processing 

* Blood collection should be done pre-operation and as close as possible to the time when the tissue is donated to the biobank or at an alternative time, if appropriate for the research study. 

# Verification of Identification Information on Tubes 

* As applicable, verify the accuracy of patient information (in keeping with privacy and ethical policies) and ensure that it corresponds with the information on labels on blood collection tubes. 
 
# Accessioning of EDTA Blood Tubes

* For EDTA (lavender-top) blood tubes, three (3) 4mL lavender-top EDTA tubes will be provided in a standard bio-hazard bag with the corresponding blood collection sheet. 
* Upon receiving the blood collection tubes, 
* One blood tube label should be placed on the side of each lavender-top tube after blood collection has taken place. 

# Accession of PAXgene Blood Tubes
* For PAXgene (DNA & RNA) blood tubes, two tubes will be provided with labels specifying downstream processing (DNA or RNA extraction).
* Similarly, one blood tube label should be placed on the side of each PAXgene tube after blood collection has taken place. 

# Separation of Plasma from the Cellular Fraction

The whole blood can be processed directly for DNA or RNA, or processed as described below to obtain a buffy coat fraction and plasma for cryopreservation.   

* In the area designated by the biobank for processing blood, fractionate the whole blood (blood collected in tubes containing an anticoagulant such as ethylene-diamineteraacetic acid-EDTA or Heparin) by centrifuging at 1500-2000 x g for 15 minutes at room temperature.  This will separate the blood into three visible layers (see Figure 1):
    * The upper layer is generally clear and pale yellow in colour. 
    * The second layer is a narrow grayish white interface band representing the “buffy coat” or leukocyte fraction.
    * The third or bottom layer is dark red and consists of the erythrocytes or red blood cells.  
* Using an appropriate disposable transfer pipette, aspirate off the plasma layer down to approximately 1 mm from the buffy coat layer.  Take care not to disturb the leukocyte or buffy coat layer. 
* Expel all plasma from the pipette into a plasma collection tube.
* Aliquot recovered plasma and place into labelled (green-top) cryovials.
* Record position and location of the tubes and enter the information into the LIMS system.

 

 
Figure 1: Blood Samples during WBC Recovery

# Recovery of White Blood Cells 

* After removing the plasma layer, use a transfer pipette to aspirate all of the buffy coat layer (usually a volume of 0.5 mL or less). 
* Expel the buffy coat into a single cryovial.  Triturate the sample, and then take half the sample and store in a separate cryovial.
* Place the cryovials in appropriate storage units.  For long-term storage, -130° C or colder is recommended.
* Record position and location of the tubes and enter into the LIMS.

# Separation of Serum from Blood Samples 

* If serum is to be obtained from the blood samples, collect the blood in appropriate tubes. 
* For non-gel serum tubes, invert the tubes 8 times immediately following collection to ensure proper coagulation.
* Incubate to ensure complete coagulation.  It is recommended to process within 1 hour.
* Prepare the required amount of 2 ml cryovials to be used for storage of the serum with the relevant labels on each tube.
* Following incubation, centrifuge the serum tubes at 1500 g for 15 minutes.
* Aspirate the supernatant and transfer directly to the labelled cryovials.
* Place the cryovials in appropriate storage units.  For long-term storage, -130° C or colder is recommended.
* Record the position and location of the vials in the storage container.

# Alternate Processing of Blood Samples

If blood has been collected in specific collection tubes for extraction of DNA or RNA then proceed with processing of these collection tubes as per established procedures for DNA and RNA processing and extraction.
