}
[/block]
Tissue samples are collected from patients that have been through the informed consent process and agreed to participate in the tumor biobank program.  Genomic studies often utilize nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) derived from these samples.  When extracting and storing deoxyribonucleic acid (RNA) from blood samples all efforts should be made to avoid contamination, prevent degradation and preserve molecular integrity.  The purpose of this document is to outline standardized procedures for the TJUHBB to follow when extracting RNA from blood samples using the PAXgene RNA Extraction Kit.

This standard operating procedure (SOP) describes how RNA should be extracted from blood samples.  The SOP does not cover detailed safety procedures for handling Human Biological Materials (HBMs) or hazardous chemicals and it is recommended that personnel follow institutional safety guidelines.

# Preparation
* Ensure that the PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes are incubated for at least 2 hours at room temperature after blood collection to ensure complete lysis of blood cells. Incubation of the PAXgene Blood RNA Tube overnight may increase yields. If the PAXgene Blood RNA Tube was stored at 2–8°C or –20°C or –70°C after blood collection, first equilibrate it to room temperature, and then store it at room temperature for 2 hours before starting the procedure.
* A shaker–incubator is required in steps 5 and 20. Set the temperature of the shaker–incubator to 55°C.
* Buffer BR2 may form a precipitate upon storage. If necessary, warm to 37°C to dissolve.
* Buffer BR4 is supplied as a concentrate. Before using for the first time, add 4 volumes of ethanol (96–100%) as indicated on the bottle to obtain a working solution.
* If using the RNase-Free DNase Set for the first time, prepare DNase I stock solution. Dissolve the solid DNase I (1500 Kunitz units)* in 550 μl of the RNase-free water provided with the set. Take care that no DNase I is lost when opening the vial. Do not vortex the reconstituted DNase I. DNase I is especially sensitive to physical denaturation. Mixing should only be carried out by gently inverting the tube.

# Storage
* Current data shows that reconstituted DNase I can be stored at 2–8°C for up to 6 weeks. For long-term storage of DNase I, remove the stock solution from the glass vial, divide it into single-use aliquots (use the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes supplied with the kit; there are enough for 5 aliquots), and store at –20°C for up to 9 months. Thawed aliquots can be stored at 2–8°C for up to 6 weeks. Do not refreeze the aliquots after thawing.

# Procedure
 1. Centrifuge the PAXgene Blood RNA Tube for 10 minutes at 3000–5000 x g using a swing-out rotor. 
* Note: Ensure that the blood sample has been incubated in the PAXgene Blood RNA Tube for a minimum of 2 hours at room temperature (15–25°C), in order to achieve complete lysis of blood cells.
* Note: The rotor must contain tube adapters for round-bottom tubes. If other types of tube adapter are used, the tubes may break during centrifugation.

 2. Remove the supernatant by decanting or pipetting. Add 4 ml RNase-free water to the pellet, and close the tube using a fresh secondary BD Hemogard closure (supplied with the kit). 
* If the supernatant is decanted, take care not to disturb the pellet, and dry the rim of the tube with a clean paper towel.

 3. Vortex until the pellet is visibly dissolved, and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 3000–5000 x g using a swing-out rotor. Remove and discard the entire supernatant.
* Small debris remaining in the supernatant after vortexing but before centrifugation will not affect the procedure.
* Note: Incomplete removal of the supernatant will inhibit lysis and dilute the lysate, and therefore affect the conditions for binding RNA to the PAXgene membrane.

 4. Add 350 μl Buffer BR1, and vortex until the pellet is visibly dissolved.
 
 5. Pipet the sample into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 300 μl Buffer BR2 and 40 μl proteinase K. Mix by vortexing for 5 seconds, and incubate for 10 minutes at 55°C using a shaker–incubator at 400–1400rpm. After incubation, set the temperature of the shaker–incubator to 65°C (for step 20).
* Note: Do not mix Buffer BR2 and proteinase K together before adding them to the sample.

 6. Pipet the lysate directly into a PAXgene Shredder spin column (lilac) placed in a 2 ml processing tube, and centrifuge for 3 minutes at maximum speed (but not to exceed 20,000 x g).
* Note: Carefully pipet the lysate into the spin column and visually check that the lysate is completely transferred to the spin column.
To prevent damage to columns and tubes, do not exceed 20,000 x g.
* Note: Some samples may flow through the PAXgene Shredder spin column without centrifugation. This is due to low viscosity of some samples and should not be taken as an indication of product failure.

 7. Carefully transfer the entire supernatant of the flow-through fraction to a fresh 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube without disturbing the pellet in the processing tube.

 8. Add 350 μl ethanol (96–100%). Mix by vortexing, and centrifuge briefly (1–2 seconds at 500–1000 x g) to remove drops from the inside of the tube lid.
* Note: The length of the centrifugation must not exceed 1–2 seconds, as this may result in pelleting of nucleic acids and reduced yields of total RNA.

 9. Pipet 700 μl sample into the PAXgene RNA spin column (red) placed in a 2 ml processing tube, and centrifuge for 1 minute at 8000–20,000 x g. Place the spin column in a new 2 ml processing tube, and discard the old processing tube containing flow-through.

 10. Pipet the remaining sample into the PAXgene RNA spin column, and centrifuge for 1 minute at 8000–20,000 x g. Place the spin column in a new 2 ml processing tube, and discard the old processing tube containing flow-through.
* Note: Carefully pipet the sample into the spin column and visually check that the sample is completely transferred to the spin column.

 11. Pipet 350 μl Buffer BR3 into the PAXgene RNA spin column. Centrifuge for 1 minute at 8000–20,000 x g. Place the spin column in a new 2 ml processing tube, and discard the old processing tube containing flow-through.

 12. Add 10 μl DNase I stock solution to 70 μl Buffer RDD in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Mix by gently flicking the tube, and centrifuge briefly to collect residual liquid from the sides of the tube.
* If processing, for example, 10 samples, add 100 μl DNase I stock solution to 700 μl Buffer RDD. Use the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes supplied with the kit.
* Note: DNase I is especially sensitive to physical denaturation. Mixing should only be carried out by gently flicking the tube. Do not vortex.

 13. Pipet the DNase I incubation mix (80 μl) directly onto the PAXgene RNA spin column membrane, and place on the benchtop (20–30°C) for 15 minutes.
* Note: Ensure that the DNase I incubation mix is placed directly onto the membrane. DNase digestion will be incomplete if part of the mix is applied to and remains on the walls or the O-ring of the spin column.

 14. Pipet 350 μl Buffer BR3 into the PAXgene RNA spin column, and centrifuge for 1 minute at 8000–20,000 x g. Place the spin column in a new 2 ml processing tube, and discard the old processing tube containing flow-through.

 15. Pipet 500 μl Buffer BR4 to the PAXgene RNA spin column, and centrifuge for 1 minute at 8000–20,000 x g. Place the spin column in a new 2 ml processing tube, and discard the old processing tube containing flow-through.
* Note: Buffer BR4 is supplied as a concentrate. Ensure that ethanol is added to Buffer BR4 before use.

 16. Add another 500 μl Buffer BR4 to the PAXgene RNA spin column. Centrifuge for 3 minutes at 8000–20,000 x g.

 17. Discard the tube containing the flow-through, and place the PAXgene RNA spin column in a new 2 ml processing tube. Centrifuge for 1 minute at 8000–20,000 x g.

 18. Discard the tube containing the flow-through. Place the PAXgene RNA spin column in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, and pipet 40 μl Buffer BR5 directly onto the PAXgene RNA spin column membrane. Centrifuge for 1 minute at 8000–20,000 x g to elute the RNA.
* It is important to wet the entire membrane with Buffer BR5 in order to achieve maximum elution efficiency.

 19. Repeat the elution step (step 18) as described, using 40 μl Buffer BR5 and the same microcentrifuge tube.

 20. Incubate the eluate for 5 minutes at 65°C in the shaker–incubator (from step 5) without shaking. After incubation, chill immediately on ice.
* Note: This incubation at 65°C denatures the RNA for downstream applications. Do not exceed the incubation time or temperature.

#Storage

* If the RNA samples will not be used immediately, store at –130°C or below. 
* Aliquote samples into cryovials containing at least 20 micrograms of RNA.
