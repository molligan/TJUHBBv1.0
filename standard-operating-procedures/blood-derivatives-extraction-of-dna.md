}
[/block]
Tissue samples are collected from patients that have been through the informed consent process and agreed to participate in the tumor biobank program.  Genomic studies often utilize nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) derived from these samples.  When extracting and storing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from blood samples all efforts should be made to avoid contamination, prevent degradation and preserve molecular integrity.  The purpose of this document is to outline standardized procedures for the TJUHBB to follow when extracting DNA from blood samples.

[/block]
This standard operating procedure (SOP) describes how DNA should be extracted from blood samples.  The SOP does not cover detailed safety procedures for handling Human Biological Materials (HBMs) or hazardous chemicals and it is recommended that personnel follow institutional safety guidelines.

# Preparation
* Thaw frozen PAXgene Blood DNA Tubes in a wire rack at ambient temperature
(18–25°C) for approximately 2 hours or at 37°C in a water bath for approximately
15 minutes. Carefully invert the thawed PAXgene Blood DNA Tubes 10 times
before beginning the procedure.
* Heat a heating block or water bath to 65°C for use in steps 8 and 17.
* Add 1.4 ml Buffer BG4 (resuspension buffer) to lyophilized PreAnalytiX Protease.
Dissolved PreAnalytiX Protease should be stored at 2–8°C or in aliquots at –20°C.
* For every sample, mix 5 ml Buffer BG3 (digestion buffer) and 50 µl reconstituted
PreAnalytiX Protease. For example, to process 10 samples, mix 50 ml Buffer BG3
with 500 µl PreAnalytiX Protease. The Buffer BG3–PreAnalytiX Protease mixture
should be prepared immediately before the start of the procedure.

# Procedure
1. Pour all the blood from one PAXgene Blood DNA Tube into a Processing Tube
containing 25 ml Buffer BG1. Close the tube. To avoid cracking the blue lids of the
Processing Tubes, do not overtighten them. Tighten the lid only until the first sign
of resistance is felt. Mix by inverting the tube 5 times.
If the blood in the PAXgene Blood DNA Tube has separated into plasma and red
blood cells, invert the tubes carefully 10 times to homogenize the sample.
2. Centrifuge for 5 min at 2500 x g in a swing-out rotor.
3. Carefully discard the supernatant and place the tube in a rack.
In rare cases the pellet may be loose, so pour slowly.
4. Add 5 ml Buffer BG2, close the tube, and wash the pellet by vortexing vigorously
for 5 s.
5. Centrifuge for 3 min at 2500 x g in a swing-out rotor.
6. Carefully discard the supernatant and place the tube back in the rack.
In rare cases the pellet may be loose, so pour slowly.
7. Add 5 ml Buffer BG3/PreAnalytiX Protease (see “Things to do before starting”), close
the tube, and vortex for 20 s at high speed.
Vortexing for 20 s is essential to dissolve the pellet completely. Shorter vortexing times
may lead to incomplete resuspension of the pellet and reduced DNA yield or purity.
After this step, samples can be stored for at least 7 days at 2–8°C. After storage,
resume the procedure at step 8.
8. Place the tube in a heating block or water bath and incubate at 65°C for 10 min.
The sample changes color from light red to light green, indicating that protein
digestion has occurred.
9. Vortex again for 5 s at high speed.
10. Add 5 ml isopropanol (100%) and mix by inverting the tube at least 20 times until
the white DNA strands clump visibly together.
Complete mixing with isopropanol is essential to precipitate the DNA and should be
checked by inspection. Only tightly clumped DNA strands can be efficiently pelleted
by centrifugation. Do not vortex as this might reduce DNA yield.
11. Centrifuge for 3 min at 2500 x g.
12. Discard the supernatant and leave the tube inverted on a clean piece of absorbent
paper for 1 min.
In rare cases the pellet may be loose, so pour slowly. Inverting the tube onto
absorbent paper minimizes backflow of isopropanol from the rim and sides of the
tube onto the pellet.
13. Add 5 ml 70% (v/v) ethanol and vortex for 1 s at high speed.
14. Centrifuge for 3 min at 2500 x g.
15. Discard the supernatant and leave the tube inverted on a clean piece of absorbent
paper for at least 5 min.
In rare cases the pellet may be loose, so pour slowly. Inverting the tube onto
absorbent paper minimizes backflow of ethanol from the rim and sides of the tube
onto the pellet.
16. Carefully dab the tube onto absorbent paper to remove ethanol from the rim, and
leave it inverted for a further 5 min to allow the DNA pellet to dry.
Avoid overdrying the pellet, since overdried DNA is very difficult to dissolve.
17. Add 1 ml Buffer BG4 and dissolve the DNA by incubating for 1 h at 65°C in a heating
block or water bath, followed by incubation overnight at room temperature.
Highly concentrated, high-molecular-weight genomic DNA samples may not
redissolve completely after an incubation of 1 h at 65°C, therefore an additional
overnight incubation at room temperature is recommended.

# Storage
* Aliquot the sample allowing for at least 20 micrograms of DNA per cryovial.
* Store DNA aliquots in the appropriate storage container (-130°C or below).
