Employees at the TJUHBB biobank have access to confidential information in the form of patient medical records.  Medical information is protected under federal and provincial privacy laws and under the terms of the consent process.  Furthermore, information may also be bound under non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements.  Employees with access to this information may not disclose it.

  "title": "PROCEDURES"
}
[/block]
These procedures outline steps that should be followed to ensure that employees who have access to confidential information sign a Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement (CDA) that addresses privacy issues.  It is intended to protect the rights of the patient and researchers that share proprietary information in the process of transactions with the tumor biobank.

  "title": "Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement"
}
[/block]
The CDA should contain at least the following elements: 

  * Definition of confidential information 
  * Knowledge of the appropriate relevant policies (POL 7-Material and Information Handling and POL 4-Privacy and Security)
  * Exclusions (if any) from confidential information 
  * Obligations of the employees 
  * Miscellaneous provisions if relevant
[block:api-header]
{
  "type": "basic",
  "title": "CDAs – Completion of Agreement"
}
[/block]
* Request that all employees at the tumor biobank (that will have access to patient or research information) complete a CDA. 
* Obtain, in duplicate, a completed (signed, dated and witnessed by a supervisor) CDA prior to the employee being granted any access to sensitive information.
* Ensure that a supervisor or manager has signed and dated the CDA.  
* Retain one copy of the signed and witnessed CDA in hardcopy for the tumour biobank records. 
* Provide the duplicate copy to the employee for their records.

Appendix A has a sample CDA that may be used.  This is a recommended agreement and biobanks may modify it to meet the local privacy laws and requirements.
