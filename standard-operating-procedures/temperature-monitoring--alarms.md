}
[/block]
Temperature monitoring is instrumental in ensuring biospecimen quality and longevity. Biospecimens are subject to degradation at the tissue, cell, and molecular levels unless temperatures are kept sufficiently low. Furthermore, large deviations in operating temperatures and repeated freeze-thaw cycles can also negatively affect biospecimen integrity. Therefore, it is important to monitor the temperature of biospecimen storage units and have adequate reporting and recovery procedures if temperature deviations occur.

This standard operating procedure (SOP) describes how the temperature of biospecimen storage units should be monitored. Furthermore, this document describes the procedures required if a temperature deviation is encountered.

# Temperature Monitoring
* Temperature monitoring is conducted autonomously through the LabAlert FusionLive software. Temperature probes are placed within the freezer at the same location as the internal temperature probe ( Panasonic NTCPBUNIV) via the freezer port.
* The probe is connected is to the transmitter (Panasonic NTCUNIVZBPS) which relays the temperature of the probe over an independent wireless connection at 15 minute intervals.
* The temperature readout from the transmitter is received by the gateway (Panasonic NTCGATEWAYT) which is connected to the local area network and relays all of the temperature information to LabAlert servers.
* A record of hourly temperatures for every probe are are stored as reports on the LabAlert servers and can be summoned at anytime via the reports tab. (See Figure 1)

# Alarms
* If temperature deviations occur outside the specified range, a warning will be issued initially. This warning is received by the biobank technologist through SMS message and email. 
* If the temperature deviation continues past the alarm threshold, the biobank technologist will be alerted via SMS message and email. 
* Simultaneously, a ticket will be created that will require documentation regarding the cause of the alarm as well as any actions taken (see Figure 3). These tickets can be found under the "Tickets" tab at the bottom of the screen.

* The following fields are required documentation for any ticket created.
    * Ticket Cause - Document the underlying cause of the alarm
    * Ticket Action - Document any actions that were required to either stop the alarm and/or prevent future alarms of a similar type from occurring.
    * Acknowledge - Document that the alarm was acknowledged by the technologist.
* If any report costs are incurred or if the equipment being monitored is still in warranty, these can be optionally documented as well.
