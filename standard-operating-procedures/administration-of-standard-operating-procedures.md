Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are detailed written descriptions of how to execute a particular procedure or method.  SOPs are based on national and international guidelines and conventions as well as policies and procedures that are considered “best practice” for the Thomas Jefferson University member biobanks.

The purpose of having documented SOPs is to:
* Provide written guidelines for aspects of the TJUH tumor biobank program.
* Promote quality and consistency in tumor biobanking and data collection across the TJUH member biobanks.
* Ensure compliance with applicable regulations and guidelines.
* Facilitate education and training of biobank personnel.

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) describes the processes for the development, review, approval and maintenance of all TJUHBB written SOPs.  It applies to all tumor biobank personnel involved in writing, revising, reviewing, approving and maintaining SOPs.

SOPs are controlled documents designed to give instructions for performing routine and essential processes, to ensure that they are performed consistently and in a manner upholding CTRNet program quality and integrity.

# Developing New SOPs or Revising Previously Issued SOPs

* TJUHBB management at the biobank or biobank personnel can identify the need for new/revised SOPs.  The need can arise from the findings of a routine SOP review or from changes to regulations, guidelines, research practice, or institutional policies.
* Individuals well versed with the procedures or methods being described should be recruited to draft or assist in drafting a new or revised SOP.
* The SOP should follow the standard format (see SOP template, Appendix A); the word “draft” should be added to the header.  For major revisions to previous SOPs, the major SOP version number must be incremented by one (e.g., 1.0 becomes 2.0). For minor revisions to previous SOPs, the minor version number must be incremented by 1(e.g. 1.0 becomes e1.1). The first version of an SOP is always 1.0.
* Develop/revise associated attachments, as applicable and revise the version date.
* Update the SOP index (see Attachment B) as necessary (e.g., for new SOPs added).

# Review and Approval of SOPs
* Circulate the draft SOP to the applicable reviewers (SOP working committee, management at local biobanks, biobank personnel, and other identified staff representatives – e.g., SOP users) for comments.
* Incorporate the comments, revise the draft version date and circulate the revised draft SOP to the biobank Director or designate.
* Review the final draft SOP for accuracy and completeness and for compliance with regulations, guidelines and standard practice.  In some circumstances, this may involve REB approval of amendment.   Also, should note whether change in SOP will require amendment to other administrative documents, especially any applicable Privacy Impact Assessments.
* Obtain approval (from a SOP authorized signatory) of the final SOP. 
* Add the effective date to the front page (the date that the final signed-off SOP is scheduled to be implemented).  Remove “draft” from the header. 
 
# Format and Content of SOPs
* Write the SOP using the formatting and styles (e.g. Arial) as shown in the standard SOP template (Appendix A).
* Complete the heading and footer information as shown in the SOP Template.
* The effective date refers to the date that the approved SOP is to be implemented.
* An SOP index should be created to list all of the approved SOPs, separating them into logical categories (Attachment B).  The example below separates the SOPs into categories corresponding to the general flow of the Tumor Biobank operations. Combining the abbreviated SOP category with the series number creates the SOP number.  The original list of SOPs may contain gaps in the numbering sequence, in order to accommodate new SOPs in logical order.

    "9-1": "09.001"
  },

* For new SOPs, assign the next consecutive number in the appropriate category.  The SOP version number for each original (new) SOP will be 1.0.
* Divide the content into sections as shown in the SOP Template (Appendix A).
* For revisions to previously issued SOPs, include a summary of and rationale for the revision in Section 10.
* Although SOP attachments may be reviewed, revised and approved separately from the SOP, they should be stored with the applicable SOP.  
* The SOP index may also contain sub-categories if necessary, as shown above for category 08 – Material Handling and Documentation.
# SOP Maintenance
* Institute a review process for SOPs.
* SOPs should be reviewed regularly (see Appendix B for suggested review schedule).  The SOPs should be reviewed sooner if there are changes to regulations, guidelines, research practice, or institutional policies.
* Once an SOP is reviewed, complete the SOP Review Record (Appendix C) file copy with CTRNet and regional biobank central office.
* If revisions to an SOP are required, follow the review and approval process (See Section 
7.1)
* If only revisions to an attachment are needed, modifications may be made without revising the SOP.   Revise the attachment, update the version date, and file a copy with CTRNet and the regional biobank central office. 

# SOP Distribution and Communication 
* SOPs should be readily available to all tumour biobank personnel and other identified staff users. 
* Notify all biobank personnel, management members of the biobank, and other identified staff users of any new or revised SOPs, and the rationale for the SOP or SOP changes.  Ideally, direct users should be notified immediately of new/revised SOPs. 
* Provide training on new or revised SOPs.  Document training as appropriate to meet regional or institutional requirements.
* Retrieve outdated copies of SOPs and attachments and replace with updated versions.
* Outdated SOPs, appendices and SOP indices should be archived.

# SOP Storage 
* The CTRNet and the regional tumour biobank should create and maintain a central SOP file.  
* Store the following documents in the central SOP files:
    * SOP Distribution Records (Appendix D) or electronic audit trail if relevant.
    * Final, approved original and revised versions of each SOP.
    * One copy of the original and revised versions of each SOP appendix.
    * Original, signed SOP Review Records.
    * Copies of SOP training records from the collection sites (if maintained)
* For electronic SOPs, final SOPs should be posted in a format that cannot be altered (e.g., .pdf format).   Ensure that the electronic files are checked regularly and only current SOPs are referenced.

# SOP Style
* Describe each operation in a procedure as a separate step.  Make instructions explicit enough so that a qualified individual could perform the procedure by following the instructions.  Make instructions explicit enough so that the SOP may be used as a training tool, and easily referred to for guidance during routine work.
* Use clear, concise, unambiguous instructions so that the user can understand the requirements.  Do not use qualifiers and vague terms such as “usually”, “sometimes”, “normally”, “regularly” or “try to”.
* Flow charts may be included, as they are an excellent way of communicating the sequential steps of a process.  Equipment diagrams and scanned images can also help personnel understand machinery, and are useful aids during hands-on training sessions.
