}
[/block]
Tissue samples are collected from patients that have been through the informed consent process and agreed to participate in the tumor biorepository program.  Tumor tissues are obtained by qualified personnel and are collected for the iorepository only if present in excess to that required for pathological assessment and diagnosis. The purpose of this document is to outline standardized procedures for the TJUH Brain Biorepository to follow during tumor tissue harvesting.

}
[/block]
This standard operating procedure (SOP) describes how tissues should be harvested.  The SOP does not cover detailed safety procedures for handling Human Biological Materials (HBMs) and it is recommended that personnel follow institutional biosafety guidelines.

[/block]
This procedure is intended to ensure that tissue samples will be collected from consented participants in a safe and efficient manner while eliminating the risks of contamination.  To facilitate the use of innovative genomic and proteomic techniques, banked tissue that has been adequately processed is vital to obtaining products with high integrity and quality. 

# Tissue Harvesting
* Treat all tissue as potentially infectious.
* Have the tissue dissection kit (as seen in Figure 1) prepared in advanced in the BSL-2 hood.

* Place the tissue in a sterile petri dish using clean technique. Be sure not to touch any surfaces that will be touched by the tissue (i.e. the inside of the petri dish). 
* Slice the tissue with a clean scalpel.  Always use a clean scalpel between tissue samples or between normal and tumor tissue.
* Identify areas of frank cauterization and/or necrosis and exclude these areas from the tissue specimen by dissection.
* Specimens should be dissected into nine (9) aliquots of equal size, with a minimum size of approximately two cubic millimeters (roughly, half the size of a grain of rice).
* Specimens should be no larger than seven (7) cubic millimeters to ensure rapid freezing.
* If all nine aliquots are available:
    * One (1) aliquot should be formalin fixed and placed in the cryovial containing 1 mL of neutral buffered formalin. This cryovial is designated with a clear cap.
    * Two (2) aliquots should be preserved with RNAlater and placed in the cryovial containing 0.5 mL of RNA later. These cryovials are designated with a red cap.
    * Six (6) aliquots should be snap frozen and placed in the empty cryovials. These cryovials are designated by a blue cap.
* If the tumor amount exceeds nine aliquots at the largest aliquot size (6-7 cubic millimeters), then additional snap frozen specimens can be collected.
* The blue cryovials designated for snap freezing preservation should be secured into the metal cryovial sticks in sets of three (see Figure 2).

* Allow 5 minutes for freezing to be completed and remove the snap frozen aliquots and place them into the designated cryogenic storage boxes for permanent storage.
* The cryovials designated for RNAlater preservation should be held at room temperature for two (2) hours and then snap frozen in the same manner and finally placed into the designated cryogenic storage box for permanent storage.
