}
[/block]
Blood samples are drawn from patients that have been through the informed consent process and agreed to participate in the tumor biobank program.  Blood samples are obtained by personnel qualified to draw blood from patients in the cancer center, the hospital or in the physician’s office.  The purpose of this document is to outline standardized procedures for the TJUHBB biobank to follow for blood collection.
[block:api-header]
{

  "title": "SCOPE"
}
[/block]
This standard operating procedure (SOP) describes how blood should be drawn.  This SOP does not cover detailed safety procedures for handling blood, and personnel must follow institutional bio-safety guidelines.  When blood collection is subcontracted, the subcontractor must follow institutional guidelines.

This procedure is intended to ensure that blood samples will be obtained from consented participants in a safe and efficient manner while eliminating the risks of contamination.

Blood products are a precious resource in the tumor biobank and procedures must be followed to obtain products with high integrity and quality.

# Timing for Blood Collection

* Preferably, blood collection should be done pre-operation and as close as possible to the time when the tissue is donated to the biobank or at an alternative time, if appropriate for the research study.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "If blood collection is not possible pre-operatively (either due to repeated unsuccessful venipuncture or patient refusal) peri-operative blood is an acceptable substitute. The blood is drawn after anesthetic induction is achieved, either through venipuncture or withdrawal from an existing arterial line.",
  "title": "Peri-operative Blood Draw"
}
[/block]

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "body": "If peri-operative blood is taken, it must be noted in the biorepository LIMS that the blood draw was peri-operative and specify the method by which the blood was drawn (venipuncture vs arterial-line).",
  "title": "Documentation"
}
[/block]

* Identify the person responsible for processing the blood collection and arrange for timely processing (Refer to TJUHBB SOP 08.02.002 – Blood Processing and Storage for further details).

# Blood Collection Procedure - Preparation

* Personnel qualified by training to draw blood must perform blood collection.
* Start filling out the blood collection worksheet.  Identify the patient, verify identification, and check that informed consent has been obtained.
* Record the time that blood was drawn.
* Assess patient’s physical and mental disposition and determine if this is the appropriate time to draw blood. 
* Be courteous, professional, and sensitive to the patient’s needs.  Ensure that all communications are discreet and respectful of patient confidentiality.
* Assemble proper equipment to draw blood.  (See Below)
 
# Blood Collection Procedure – Drawing Blood

* Provide for the patient’s comfort as much as possible, and gain the patient’s cooperation. Position the patient.  The patient should sit in a chair, lie down or sit up in bed.  Hyperextend the patient’s arm.
* Apply tourniquet to expose veins.  Do not place too tightly. If superficial veins are not easily apparent, force blood into the vein by massaging the arm from wrist to elbow, tap the site with index and second finger, apply a warm, damp cloth to the site or lower extremity to allow veins to fill.
* Select appropriate site for venipuncture.  Avoid areas with excessive scars or hematomas. While hand and wrist veins are acceptable it is optimal to select an antecubital vein. 
* Prepare the patient’s arm using alcohol swab.  Cleanse in a circular fashion, beginning at the site and working outward.  Allow to air dry.
* Anchor the vein and swiftly insert the needle (at a 15-30 degree angle with the surface of the arm) into the lumen of the vein.  Avoid excessive probing and trauma to the site. 
* Draw approximately 3ml in a throw away tube first and then begin drawing blood for the biobank. This is to prevent contamination.
* Draw blood (4-5ml is the recommended minimum volume) into an evacuated blood collection tube.  Fill in additional appropriate tubes for DNA and RNA extraction if relevant.
* When the last tube to be drawn is filling, remove the tourniquet.
* Remove the needle from the patient and apply a gauze and adequate pressure to the site of venipuncture to avoid hematoma formation.
* Dispose of needles and supplies in a safe manner. 
* Mix by inverting tubes 10 times.
* Place the collected blood tubes into a biohazard bag with the blood collection sheet placed in the label slip of the bag.

# Transport of Blood Sample to Pathology or Biobank Lab for Processing 

* Verify patient information (in keeping with privacy and ethical policies) and ensure that it corresponds with the information on the labels on blood collection tubes. 
* Responsible personnel or technician/technologist should transport labelled tubes to the specified area at the biobank for processing blood samples.
* Should samples be coming from a location distant to the biobank, they should be shipped express using an appropriate courier.  
* Transport tubes EDTA and PAXgene tubes at room temperature unless otherwise specified.
